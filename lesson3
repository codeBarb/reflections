>> When we're working on other devices; or working with a distributed team.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

>> Fork: when I copy someone else's github project to mine, so i can use it/modify without affecting their copy
>> Clone: when i've forked a project, i clone it to my local to make changes
>> Branches: the differences from master & branches. for when i want to change but not affect master
