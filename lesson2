What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

>> In terminal, enter git init
>> initializes the files

//

How is the staging area different from the working directory
and the repository?
>> Working directory is only what's my local hard drive. Staging area is on git.
I will be able to track versions when it's on git (not only my hard drive)

What value do you think it offers?
>> Using the version history.
