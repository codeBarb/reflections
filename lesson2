What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

>> In terminal, enter git init
>> initializes the files

//

How is the staging area different from the working directory
and the repository?
>> Working directory is only what's my local hard drive. Staging area is on git.
I will be able to track versions when it's on git (not only my hard drive)

What value do you think it offers?
>> Using the version history.


Pushing repo to github:
1. create repo in github
2. in terminal, navigate to folder
then...

git remote
barb (master *) reflections $ git remote add origin https://github.com/codeBarb/reflections.git
barb (master *) reflections $ git remote
origin
barb (master *) reflections $ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/codeBarb/reflections.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/codeBarb/reflections.git (push)
barb (master *) reflections $ git push -u origin master
>>> need to use -u in oder to enter username & password for github; then it will add it
